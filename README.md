## About

Expo Boilerplate can be used to kick start a react native project in a matter of seconds. 


## Installation

Running the project locally can easily be done in a few steps.

1. Install packages
   ```sh
   yarn
   ```
2. Start the app (in the desired environment)
   ```JS
   yarn start:dev
   ```
   ```JS
   yarn start:staging
   ```
   ```JS
   yarn start:production
   ```

<br>
Now that the project is running, you can enter the following commands in the console.
<br>
<br>

› Press `a` │ open Android emulator
› Press `i` │ open iOS simulator
› Press `w` │ open web
<br>
› Press `j` │ open debugger
› Press `r` │ reload app
› Press `m` │ toggle menu
<br>
You can also scan the QR code shown in the console with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS) to open the project on a physical device.

## Expo

[Expo](https://expo.dev/) is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React. Together with Expo Application Services ([EAS](https://expo.dev/eas)), which is a deeply integrated cloud services for Expo and React Native apps, from the team behind Expo, any developer with only a basic understanding of javascript can start building and submitting native apps for IOS and Android with ease.

## React Navigation

## React-i18next

[React-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) is a powerful internationalization framework for React / React Native which is based on [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/). Together with [Expo localization](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/localization/), which provides access to the locale data on the native device, the project is being translated based on the set language of the device.
